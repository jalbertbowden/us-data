    Description:
      Abstract: 
        This map layer contains waterbodies and wetlands of the United States, 
        Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The map layer was produced 
        from the medium-resolution National Hydrography Dataset waterbody 
        feature class, through feature selection and cartographic 
        generalization, based on reference to published small-scale ancillary 
        data sets.
      Purpose: 
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States 
        in the use of these data.

    Native_Data_Set_Environment: 
      Microsoft Windows XP Version 5.1.2600 (Build 2600); ESRI ArcGIS 9.3.1.4000
  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        All attributes were checked to make sure their values are in the correct 
        domains.  No null (blank) values are present except in the Name 
        attribute.

        The WaterbdyID was checked for duplicates and nulls.  All features have 
        a unique WaterbdyID.

        Names come from Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) names in the 
        National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) 100K waterbodies.  Additional names 
        were added manually based on information from other maps and data sets.  
        They were reordered so that the generic feature type such as "Lake", 
        "River", "Glacier", etc. was in the correct position for a label.  They 
        were checked for invalid characters and foreign characters.  Waterbodies 
        with no name have a null value.

        Selections by attribute and location were used to ensure the Region 
        attribute matches the region the waterbody is in.

        Perimeter in miles and area in square miles were calculated using the 
        North America Albers Equal Area Conic projection.  Features have been 
        generalized and aggregated so their measurements may be different from a 
        measurement in a larger-scale data set.
    Logical_Consistency_Report: 
      Waterbodies were checked for topological consistency using ArcGIS, to 
      ensure there were no overlapping waterbodies or small gaps between 
      waterbodies.  The topology rules were also used to check the alignment of 
      waterbodies with coastlines and international borders.  Multi-part 
      features were divided into separate waterbodies.  Waterbodies were 
      compared to aerial imagery to verify location and extent.
    Completeness_Report:
      This map layer contains waterbodies and wetlands of the United States, 
      Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Only waterbodies and wetlands 
      appropriate for a 1:1,000,000-scale data set are included.  Waterbodies 
      and wetlands smaller than one square kilometer are excluded unless one of 
      the following applies: they are in the National Atlas 1:2,000,000-scale 
      map layer, they are in other small-scale data sets or maps, they cover a 
      small coastal island, they have been merged with a larger feature, or 
      their size has been reduced during alignment with other 1:1,000,000-scale 
      map layers.

      Swamps and marshes may be underrepresented in some areas.  In the 
      southeastern U.S. some swamp/marsh limits were difficult to determine 
      due to unclear or conflicting information in imagery, topographical maps, 
      and landcover.  In Alaska, swamps and marshes appear to be 
      underrepresented when compared to land cover data sets and topographical 
      maps.

      Waterbodies and wetlands may also be underrepresented in areas that 
      contain large numbers of small isolated features which were too far apart 
      to aggregate and too small to be included by themselves.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
          Waterbodies and wetlands are in approximately the same locations as in 
          the NHD 100K waterbodies data used as a source.  However, many 
          processes and editing tasks resulted in the movement of waterbody 
          and wetland limits from their original positions, including: 
          generalizing and aggregating waterbodies and wetlands, modifying 
          waterbodies and wetlands to meet minimum width standards, moving 
          waterbody and wetland limits 300 meters from transportation features 
          if the two were parallel, extending or trimming waterbodies and 
          wetlands to intersect coastlines or international boundaries, 
          increasing or decreasing the gap between neighboring waterbodies and 
          wetlands, adjusting waterbodies and wetlands to fit the streams that 
          flow through them, and modifying waterbodies and wetlands to match 
          imagery.

          were exported as a new feature class, then simplified using the Bend 
          Simplify algorithm with a tolerance of 500 meters.  The feature class 
          was further simplified using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm with a 1-
          meter tolerance to remove extraneous vertices.  The new, simplified 
          and generalized data set was checked for multipart features, overlaps, 
          and gaps.  Topology errors were corrected.

          During the generalization process, waterbodies sometimes became

          waterbody limits were corrected so that the streams flow through the

          were lake, lake dry, lake intermittent, reservoir, and stream.  No

          wetlands.  To ensure alignment of waterbodies and coastlines, the data 
          were checked for topological consistency using ArcGIS.

          Elimination of Small Islands and Gaps Within and Between Waterbodies

          The 1 square kilometer size threshold for waterbodies and wetlands 
          eliminated many small waterbodies that were completely surrounded by 
          larger waterbodies (usually a lake within a wetland).  This left holes 
          in the waterbodies or wetlands.  There were also gaps between 
          waterbodies and islands within waterbodies, some of which were too 
          small for the scale of the map layer.  Polygons were created for the 
          small holes and gaps and merged with the surrounding waterbodies or 
          wetlands.

          Cartographic Generalization - Phase 2

          A second phase of generalization was needed to address the width of 
          waterbodies and the distance between waterbodies.  It was determined 
          that a minimum waterbody width of 500 meters was appropriate for this 
          scale.  Sections of a waterbody that were as narrow as 300 meters were 
          acceptable if they connected wider areas or if they were the tapered 
          end of a waterbody.  

          The Buffer tool was used with a series of negative and positive buffer 
          distances to create two sets of interior polygons for the waterbodies, 
          one set representing the parts of the waterbodies that were at least 
          300 meters wide, and another set representing the parts of the 
          waterbodies that were at least 500 meters wide.  The waterbodies were 
          then edited manually using the interior polygons as guidelines and 
          using imagery, land cover, NHDPlus Waterbody, NHDPlus Area, and 
          topographical maps to support decisions.  Some features were 
          eliminated based on width.  Other features were trimmed, widened, or 
          merged with neighboring features.

          The minimum acceptable distance between waterbodies was 300 meters.  A 
          set of exterior buffers 150 meters wide was created from the 
          waterbodies.  If the exterior buffer of one feature overlapped that of 
          another, the two features were separated or merged, or they were 
          modified so that they shared a common limit.  Imagery, land cover, 
          NHDPlus Waterbody, NHDPlus Area, and topographical maps were used to 
          support decisions.

          Addition of the Great Lakes

          A Great Lakes polygon was created with the 1:1M coastline as the 
          southern limit and the 1:1M national boundary between the 
          United States and Canada as the northern limit.  The resulting 
          polygon was then divided into Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake 
          Huron, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and smaller adjacent lakes, bays, and 
          rivers.
