  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer includes cities in the United States, Puerto Rico and the 
      U.S. Virgin Islands.  These cities were collected from the 1970
      National Atlas of the United States.  Where applicable, U.S. Census Bureau
      codes for named populated places were associated with each name to allow
      additional information to be attached. The Geographic Names Information
      System (GNIS) was also used as a source for additional information.  This
      is a revised version of the December 2003 map layer. 
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in 
      the use of these data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Digitized place names from the 1970 National Atlas of the United States 
        were compared with U.S. Census Bureau place names from FIPS55-3_98.  
        Where there were discrepancies, names from the GNIS were used.  A small 
        number of places could not be assigned FIPS55 codes and were removed 
        from the map layer.  Minor positional corrections were also made.

      Process_Description:
        No spatial data was changed in ATLAS-CITIES98.  The following edits were 
        made to the attribute data base file.  In the Feature field, 
        inconsistencies were removed and the population ranges were corrected as 
        necessary to match the 1990 population information in the Pop field.  
        Unnecessary fields were deleted (Idnum, Capcode, Stid).  Fields were 
        added for State, State_Fips, and County.  Lakewood Center, Washington 
        was changed to Lakewood, Washington with a population of 58412.  
        Incorrect population information for Lakewood, Snohomish County was 
        deleted.  Boise City, Idaho was changed to Boise, Idaho.

      Process_Description:
        Points generated from the GAZETTEER text file were added; points with 
        duplicate FIPS55 codes were removed.  County, State, and FIPS data were 
        compared and corrected, if necessary, with data from FIPS55-3_99, and 
        with POP_PL.  Remaining incorporated and Census Designated Places 
        (CDP's) from GNIS00 were added; all unincorporated and non-CDP places 
        were then removed.  A few populated places in high density areas were 
        filtered out.  Population data from the POP_ESTIMATE and GAZETTEER files 
        were added, and a population value of -99999 was used where population 
        data was not available.  Some places were updated with new FIPS55 codes.  
        Minor positional corrections were made using ATLAS-HY and ATLAS-CNTY as 
        references.  A display attribute, based on population size and distance 
        to nearest town, was added to determine which place names will be shown 
        at the most detailed scale on the National Atlas interactive map 
        browser.

        County and county FIPS fields for the town of Bloomfield, CO were

        Incorporated place names in ATLAS-CITIES03 were compared with those from 
        the GNIS database.  GNIS names were used where there were discrepancies.  
        New incorporated places were added; duplicate points and places no 
        longer incorporated were removed.  Positions of all incorporated places 
        were adjusted to match GNIS coordinates.  Minor positional corrections 
        of incorporated places were made using ATLAS-HY and ATLAS-CNTY as 
        references.  The population range values were adjusted to reflect 2000 
        population figures and the POP_2000 attribute was added; earlier 
        population figures were dropped.

      Attribute_Definition:
        A value used to specify whether a place name text label will be shown at 
        the most detailed display scale in the National Atlas Map Maker.  This 
        attribute applies only to cities and towns where the attribute Feature 
        has a value of Populated Place; all other cities and towns will have 
        Display = 0 but will still be labeled at the most detailed display 
        scale.  This attribute value is determined by a ratio based on 
        population size and distance to nearest town and was set by the 
        following steps:
        >1. Distance to the nearest neighbor was calculated for each populated 
        >   place.
        >2. Population density was calculated by adding the 1990 population 
        >   values for each county and then dividing the total by the area of 
        >   the county. The 1990 population values of -99999 were set to 1.
        >3. A display ratio was calculated using the formula 1990 Population x 
        >   Distance / Population Density.
        >4. Display was set to 1 for all points with a minimum result of 15000, 
        >   and set to 0 for the remainder of points.
        This attribute was not updated in the February 2004 version of this
