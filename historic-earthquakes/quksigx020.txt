    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer contains the locations and attributes of significant,
        historic earthquakes that caused deaths, property damage, and geological
        effects, or were otherwise experienced by populations in the United
        States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands.  Included are earthquakes
        located in the United States as well as some that occurred in adjacent
        portions of Canada and Mexico.  The main sources for the data are
        Seismicity of the United States, 1568-1989 and the Preliminary
        Determination of Epicenters for 1990 to August 2009.  This is a
        replacement for the January 2005 map layer.

      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States
        or the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.  This map layer is
        intended for a mixed audience of specialists and non-specialists alike who
        have a need for general, non-technical information about significant
        United States earthquakes.

      Supplemental_Information:
        Provided with the downloadable files is a text file,
        quksigx_references.txt, which contains the reference information for
        earthquake magnitudes listed in the data.

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        The attribute table was manually checked for unreasonable attribute values
        for depth and magnitude.
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      No formal tests for logical consistency were performed on this map layer,
      principally because the map layer contains attribute values that were
      arrived at by either or both quantitative (i.e. instrumental) and
      qualitative (i.e. historical) methods.  Earthquakes that occurred prior to
      the introduction of seismological instrumentation are known only from
      written records, such as newspapers, books and journals, and diaries, which
      often may provide contradictory information that has to be carefully
      examined and weighed.  As seismographs became more common in the early
      1960's, the origin time and location were both more precisely and accurately
      determined but the compilation and evaluation of intensity reports was, and
      still is, a process that involves considerable subjectivity.  As a result,
      all attributes associated with a given earthquake should be considered
      provisional and subject to further revision based on acquisition of new
      information and use of new analytical methods.
    Completeness_Report:
      This map layer contains information on significant, historical earthquakes
      that caused deaths, property damage, geological effects, or that were
      experienced by populations in the epicentral area, for the United States,
      Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana
      Islands.  These data are limited to the best estimates of earthquake
      locations and to attributes such as magnitude and maximum intensity.

    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
          100 meter is the nominal precision of the reported instrumentally
          located coordinate values but accuracy is considerably less.  Accuracy
          depends upon numerous factors including imprecision of the velocity
          model of the earth, uneven distribution of seismic stations, and
          imprecisions in the computational algorithm.  Following initial
          proofreading of the input data file, a preliminary map of the locations
          of the earthquakes was produced which was examined for gross errors in
          spatial location.
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
        Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
          Although depths are reported to the nearest 1 kilometer, the accuracy is
          considerably less owing to uncertainties in the velocity model of the
          Earth, uneven distribution of seismic stations, and imprecisions in the
          computational algorithm.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Data for the years 1568 to 1989, from Seismicity of the United States,
          were combined with Preliminary Determination of Epicenters data for 1990
          to 2009.  EHUS1982 and MIDAS-IPGH were used to compile information for
          additional locations or for years not covered by the other sources.  The
          resulting text file was loaded into ArcView and converted to a
          shapefile.  Three records for Puerto Rico were dropped because they did
          not include values for longitude and latitude.
