Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: The data set was checked for topological consistency using the Arc/INFO command BUILD. No other checks for logical consistency were performed on this data set.
  Completeness_Report:
    This is a subset of the data set available from the U.S. Geological Survey National Atlas.  Removed unneeded attributes.  Records with "Null" fields have been removed.  Removed features also represented in National Atlas Water Feature Areas.  Removed features with "shoreline"  as not to conflict with other shorelines (e.g. NOS80k) used by the USGS, Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Woods Hole Science Center.

    This data set includes water features for all 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original DLG files.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The geospatial part of this data set was originally extracted from the individual 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey which have a positional accuracy of 1,720 meters.  It was updated several times using various sources whose horizontal positional accuracies are unknown.

      Process_Description:
        This file was originally digitized by the National Mapping Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a single national hydrography coverage. Where necessary to effect the merge, alignment changes were made.  The names were taken from the USGS Topographic 1:100,000-scale maps.  For Alaska, the names were taken from the USGS Topographic 1:250,000-scale maps.  State lines across water bodies were removed from the national coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the features.

        Some spatial features were added and corrected.  Some name attributes were added or corrected.  All occurrences of St. were changed to Saint.  Extra spaces were removed from the attributes.  Hydrographic features for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added. A minor adjustment was made to the shoreline in Galveston Bay, Texas.
