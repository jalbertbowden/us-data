  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer shows areal and linear water features of the United States, 
      Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The original file was produced 
      by joining the individual State hydrography layers from the 1:2,000,000-
      scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data produced by the USGS.  This map layer 
      was formerly distributed as Hydrography Features of the United States.  
      This is a revised version of the January 2003 map layer.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in 
      the use of these data.

      Process_Description:
        The 2MILHY data files were originally digitized by the National Mapping 
        Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of 
        the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The
        1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a 
        single national water features coverage.  Where necessary to effect the 
        merge, alignment changes were made.  The names were taken from the USGS
        1:100,000-scale maps.  For Alaska, the names were taken from the 
        1:250,000-scale sheets.  State lines across water bodies were removed 
        from the national coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the
        features.

        Some spatial features were added and corrected.  Some name attributes 
        were added or corrected.  All occurrences of St. were changed to Saint.  
        Extra spaces were removed from the attributes.  Water features for 
        Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Names were researched for approximately 1,200 linear streams, canals, 
        aqueducts, and Intracoastal Waterway instances, in the conterminous 
        United States and Hawaii, that did not have names in ATLASHY0301.  Names 
        were determined from the USGS 1:24,000-scale maps; the remaining 
        features without names were not labeled on the 1:24,000-scale maps, or 
        fall in Alaska, or represent dams that have not yet been fully 
        researched.  Features for which no name appears within the source data 
        have a value of "NONE GIVEN" in the Name field.  Features such as 
        shorelines, apparent limits, and closure lines do not have names and 
        have a value of "N/A" in the Name field.  Several name corrections were 
        made.  Minor spatial edits required to accommodate name changes, such as 
        connecting or splitting features, were made as necessary.
