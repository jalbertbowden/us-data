  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer portrays the State boundaries of the United States, and the
      boundaries of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The map layer was 
      created by extracting the State boundary polygons from the individual 
      1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced 
      by the U.S. Geological Survey.  These files were then merged into a single 
      coverage.  This is an updated version of the June 2002 map layer; the 
      date when each State was admitted to the United States was added.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in 
      the use of these data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    The map layer was checked for topological consistency using the Arc/INFO 
    command BUILD.  No other checks for logical consistency were performed on 
    this map layer.
  Completeness_Report:
    This map layer includes State boundaries for all 50 States, and boundaries 


    for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Data completeness generally 
    reflects the content of the original DLG files.

      Process_Description:
        The 2MILBD data files were originally digitized by the National Mapping 
        Discipline of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), based on the sectional 
        maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of America' 
        published by the USGS in 1970.  The sectional maps were updated during 
        1978-1981 and digitized in the early 1980's.  The data were updated 
        again in the early 1990's by the USGS and published on CD-ROM in 1995 as 
        State DLGs.  These DLG files were updated in 1997.  Using Arc/INFO 
        software, the DLG optional format files were converted to Arc/INFO 
        coverages using the DLGARC command.  Only State political boundaries and 
        attribute information were extracted for inclusion.  The file was 
        compared to ATLAS-HY98.  State boundary lines that crossed open water 
        were excluded for graphic purposes, and polygons that represented 
        islands were attributed with the appropriate State information.  The 
        individual State coverages were then merged together using the Arc/INFO 
        command MAPJOIN.  'Slivers' created during the MAPJOIN process were 
        identified and deleted using the ELIMINATE command.
