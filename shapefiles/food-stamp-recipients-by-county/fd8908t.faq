<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

This map layer shows the estimated number of Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance (food stamp) recipients in the United States, by county,
for the years 1989, 1993, 1995, 1997-2002, and 2003-2008.  It is drawn
from United States Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service
(USDA/FNS) information on the number of people participating in the food
stamp program.  Those data were used in the production of the U.S.
Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty estimates.  Food stamp
recipient estimates are generally for July of the reference year; in a
few cases the States were able to provide data only for other reference
periods.  In 2008, the federal Food Stamps Program  was renamed the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

To create the maps in the National Atlas Map Maker,
&lt;<a href="http://nationalatlas.gov/mapmaker">http://nationalatlas.gov/mapmaker</a>&gt;, fd8902t.dbf was joined to the
county boundaries available from the National Atlas data download page,
&lt;<a href="http://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html">http://nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html</a>&gt;.  The 1989 data were joined to
the 1990 county boundaries (co1990p020), the 1993, 1995, and 1997-1999
data were joined to the 2000 county boundaries (co2000p020), and the
2000-2008 data were joined to the 2001 county boundaries (countyp020);
the more detailed 2012 county boundaries can also be used with these
data.
<br/>
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the new name
for the federal Food Stamp Program, as of October 1, 2008.  Data
originally came from the U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and
Poverty Estimates web site,
&lt;<a href="http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/model/tables.html">http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/model/tables.html</a>&gt;.

The Food Stamp data for 1989, 1993, 1995, and 1997-2002 were
downloaded in Excel format.  A row containing header information was
added, and the file was loaded into ArcView and saved as a dBASE IV
file.  The three files containing population estimates were
downloaded, loaded into ArcView, and saved as dBASE files.  The
population estimate files were joined to the food stamp file.  Fields
were added to contain the percentage of food stamp recipients for each
year.  The values for the new fields were calculated by dividing the
appropriate population estimate into the number of food stamp
recipients and multiplying by 100.  Fields that were blank were given
values of -9999 or -9.0.  A record was added for Yellowstone National
Park (FIPS 30113).  Records for individual States were deleted.
