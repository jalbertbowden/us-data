  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer contains the shallowest principal aquifers of the 
      conterminous United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
      Islands, portrayed as polygons.  The map layer was developed as part of 
      the effort to produce the maps published at 1:2,500,000 in the printed 
      series "Ground Water Atlas of the United States".  The published maps 
      contain base and cultural features not included in these data.  This is a 
      replacement for the July 1998 map layer called Principal Aquifers of the 
      48 Conterminous United States.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for use in publications, at a scale of 1:2,500,000 
      or smaller.  Due to the small scale, the primary intended use is for 
      regional and national data display and analysis, rather than specific 
      local data analysis.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The Ground Water Atlas of the United States (GWA) chapters include 
      additional information that may be relevant to the use of this map layer, 
      such as maps of alluvial and glacial aquifers that overlie the aquifers in 
      this map layer, as well as other information described below. 

      The areal extent of the aquifers, as shown in this map layer, represents 
      the area in which a named aquifer is the shallowest of the principal 
      aquifers.  These aquifer areas are not necessarily the only areas in which 
      ground water can be withdrawn, for two reasons:  1) The aquifers shown may 
      have a larger areal extent than is represented here.  The boundaries in 
      this map layer generally represent an interpretation of the surface 
      location (outcrop), or near-surface location (shallow subcrop) of the 
      uppermost principal aquifer for the area.  An aquifer may extend beyond 
      the area shown, but be overlain by one or more other aquifers, and (or) 
      low-permeability material.  2) There may be areas of water-bearing 
      surficial material not shown in this map layer.  Major alluvial aquifers 
      that occur along main watercourses are not shown.  Significant 
      unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers, that are not indicated in this 
      map layer but are important sources of water, may occur locally in 
      glaciated regions.  The user of this map layer is advised that to get 
      complete information regarding areas that serve as sources of water, more
      information about surficial aquifers needs to be obtained, particularly in 
      glaciated areas.

      This map layer was constructed by combining data created for or from the 
      regional GWA chapters.  Minor aquifers that are important local sources of 
      water were mapped in some regions, so the regional maps in the GWA may 
      show more detail than this map layer.  The data were reviewed, adjusted, 
      and published based on new information provided by national, State, and 
      local scientists.  The juxtaposition of regionally mapped aquifers has led 
      to some instances where an aquifer outcrop or shallow subcrop is bounded 
      by a State line.  This is a result of the regional mapping and national 
      categorization methods used and is not meant to imply a hydrogeologic 
      change coincident with a State boundary.

      The aquifer outcrop and shallow subcrop boundaries represent broad, 
      regional categories and should not be interpreted as site-specific.  
      Comments regarding the names of aquifers or the hydrogeologic 
      interpretation of the aquifers can be directed to the U.S. Geological 
      Survey, Water Resources Division, Office of Ground Water, 
      ogw_webmaster@usgs.gov.

      This map layer was used as part of the effort to publish a 1:5,000,000-
      scale 'Principal Aquifers' map in the National Atlas of the United States 
      of America series of printed maps.  The printed map can be considered  a 
      representation of this map layer with the exceptions of: the smaller 
      scale, slight differences in the coastline due to generalization, base and 
      cultural information, and delineation of the glacial-deposit area.

      These data were developed in conjunction with the publication of the GWA.  
      For documentation purposes, areas are referred to by their corresponding 
      GWA chapter letter, or by State.  This list shows the relationship between

      of the GWA chapter regions, as well as more information about the GWA.

      It may be helpful to refer to the printed GWA chapters when using the 
      Data, however, there are significant differences between this national 
      map layer and the printed chapters.  Because the GWA regional chapters 
      were written by different authors, there were areas of different 
      interpretations and category delineations, aquifer names, etc., that 
      became apparent when combining the regions. 

      The following listings show the differences between aquifer names in the 
      GWA chapters and the aq_name and aq_code used in this map layer.  See the 
      Entity and Attribute Information section for definitions of the data 
      attributes.

      A map layer showing the areal extent of sand and gravel aquifers of 
      alluvial and glacial origin north of the line of Quaternary continental 
      glaciation is included in the online, interactive National Atlas of the 
      United States.  This map layer ends at the southern limit of 
      glaciation in the United States; areas north of the limit line contain
      significant sand and gravel glacial deposits that are important sources of 
      water for local areas.

      For additional information on principal aquifers, please see the Aquifer 
      Basics page at <http://capp.water.usgs.gov/aquiferBasics/index.html>.

      The final data are being served to the public in the following formats: 
      Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS), Arc/INFO Export, or ArcView

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:  
        Aquifer outcrop line work for each GWA chapter was compiled on mylar at 
        a scale of 1:2,000,000, and reduced to 1:2,500,000 for further
        production work.  For chapters HA 730-G, -H, and -J, the outcrop lines 
        were scribed at a line width of 0.006 inch.  Film positives made from 
        the scribed materials were scanned on a drum scanner, vectorized, and 
        converted to Arc/INFO coverages.  For chapters HA 730-B, -C, -D, -E, -F, 
        -I, -K, -L, and -M, the aquifer compilation was either hand digitized, 
        and (or) scanned on a drum scanner, vectorized and converted to Arc/INFO 
        coverages.  The data were then checked, cleaned up, and attribute
        creation was done.

        The Arc/INFO coverages were plotted and checked against the source 
        compilations.  Polygons were attributed using Arcedit.  The coverages 
        for GWA chapters HA 730-B, -C, -D, -E, -F, -I, -K, -L, and -M were used 
        to generate output files that were imported into Adobe Illustrator
        for map publication.  Each completed map, at a scale of 1:2,500,000, was 
        reviewed for content and accuracy by the chapter lead cartographer, 
        Water Resources Discipline Geohydrologic Map Editor, and chapter author.

        Individual chapter coverages were appended into one continuous coverage.  
        Arcedit was used for edgematching and to remove duplicate labels.  No 
        DISSOLVE was done on the coverage; an equivalent of a DISSOLVE was done
        manually in Arcedit in conjunction with attribute checking, by removing 
        arcs that divided adjacent polygons with the same attributes.  Several 
        iterations of editing were performed.  These mostly involved ensuring 
        all polygons had labels and aquifer information and ensuring polygons 
        had correct aquifer information.  No polygons were removed for 
        generalization.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:  
        Plots of the national aquifers file were made at 1:2,500,000, covering 
        the areas of the regional GWA chapters.  Each plot was compared to the
        printed GWA chapter aquifer maps.  Where applicable (chapters HA 730-B, 
        -C, -D, -E, -F, -I, -K, - L, and -M), an Adobe Illustrator file of the 
        coverage data was compared on-screen with the Illustrator file used to
        print the published map.  Discrepancies between the coverage file and 
        print file were noted, and the coverage updated to match the published 
        map.  Where a line appeared to shift noticeably (approximately 1/8 inch 
        at a scale of 1:2,500,000) across the boundary of two adjacent GWA 
        chapter regions, the line was adjusted for a smoother appearance.  The 
        adjustments may have been made on one or both sides of the region 
        boundary, depending on a cartographic assessment of the instance.

        Coastline Location

        The 1:2,500,000 principal aquifer maps in the Ground Water Atlas 
        publications used a coastline and international boundary, derived either 
        from the map separates from the National Atlas of the United States of
        America (published 1970), or from the Digital Line Graph (DLG) data 
        created from the 1970 National Atlas.  GWA chapters HA 730-G, -J, and -H 
        used coastline and boundary filmwork  photo-mechanically reduced from 
        the 1:2,000,000 National Atlas map separates.  The remaining chapters
        used coastline and boundary data from the DLG's.  A revision of the DLG 
        data took place in 1997, after the creation of the chapter aquifer map 
        data. 
 
        After the edgematching, a decision was made to replace the coast and 
        international boundary of this national-level aquifer data with one 
        derived from a newer version of 1997 DLG data.  State boundary data from 
        the National Atlas was used to provide the coastline and two aquifer 
        boundaries that coincide with State lines.

        The existing outline (coastline and international boundary line) was 
        removed, the new outline added to the coverage, and the remaining 
        aquifer contact lines snapped to the new outline.  The coverage was re-
        cleaned, data categories checked onscreen and with plots, and corrected.  
        Line and labeling corrections, such as undershoots, overshoots, and 
        improper labels were corrected in Arcedit.

        There are some slight locational differences between this map layer and 
        the printed GWA chapters.  For example, there are  several small 
        differences in the number of small islands in coastal areas and the 
        categorization of these small islands was assigned to either the nearby
        principal aquifer category or as Not a principal aquifer, depending on 
        the location and categorization of similar small islands in the printed 
        GWA chapters.  There are other differences in the categorization of some
        land/shoreline-related features. For example, an area symbolized as a 
        bay in a GWA chapter may be land in this map layer.

        Western Montana

        During the review of a printed map made from this national-level aquifer 
        data, the compiler, James A. Miller, requested a change in the 
        representation of aquifers in western Montana.  The area affected is in 
        the following counties: Lincoln, Flathead, Sanders, Lake, Mineral, 
        Missoula, Powell, Ravalli, Granite, Lewis and Clark, Deer Lodge, Silver 
        Bow, Jefferson,  Broadwater, Gallatin, Beavershead, and Madison.  These 
        areas fall under the Northern Rocky Mountain Intermontane Basins 
        Regional Aquifer Systems Analysis (RASA).  With one exception, the 
        aquifers, as shown in GWA chapter I, figure 7 in the listed counties 
        were removed and replaced with unconsolidated-deposit areas as shown in 
        GWA chapter HA 730-I, figure 6.  The exception is an area in northern
        Flathead county, listed as an Upper Tertiary aquifer in GWA chapter I, 
        figure 7, that was retained as an area but reclassified as a Lower 
        Tertiary aquifer.

        Aquifer data was taken from digital files created in Adobe Illustrator 
        for Ground Water Atlas chapter HA 730-N of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the  
        U.S. Virgin Islands.  Where polygons ended at the shoreline, National 
        Atlas State boundaries were used.  The final Illustrator file was 
        exported into a DXF file.  The DXF file was converted to a coverage. 
        Using the TRANSFORM command, the coverage containing the aquifer lines 
        was rubber-sheeted to the coverage containing registration tics, and was 
        then projected from geographic coordinates to Albers Equal-Area Conic 
        projection for verification purposes.  The aquifer coverage was cleaned, 
        the topology was built, and labels were added.  Attributes were added as 
        necessary.

      Process_Description:  
        The Principal Aquifers map published in 1998 was reviewed and modified, 
        resulting in 57 aquifers, 36 of which were the same geographically as in 
        the 1998 publication.  Aquifers were aggregated, divided, renamed and 
        updated from more recent publications, using a variety of techniques, 
        which include scanning, importing unpublished digital data and paper 
        compilation at 1:2,500,000 scale.  The updated Adobe Illustrator aquifer 
        data was exported into a DXF file.  The DXF file was converted to a 
        coverage.  Using the TRANSFORM command, the coverage containing the 
        aquifer lines was rubber-sheeted to the coverage containing registration
