  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer consists of federally owned or administered lands of the
      United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Only areas of 
      640 acres or more are included.  There may be private inholdings within 
      the boundaries of Federal lands in this map layer.  This is a revised 
      version of the January 2005 map layer.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in
      the use of these data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Linear federally-owned or administered land features such as national
      parkways, wild and scenic rivers, etc. of the United States, Puerto Rico,
      and the U.S. Virgin Islands are included in the National Atlas Federal
      Land Features of the United States - Parkways and Scenic Rivers map layer.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's Arc/INFO GIS software, the map layer was checked for label
    errors, dangling nodes, and intersections.  Polygon topology was built for
    the map layer using the BUILD command.
  Completeness_Report:
    This map layer includes federal land polygon features for all 50 of the
    United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
    Islands.  The minimum map resolution is 640 acres or one square mile.
    Generally, features under this size are not shown.  There may be private
    inholdings within the boundaries of Federal lands in this map layer.

      Process_Description:
        ATLAS-FEDLNP0310 was a National Atlas file that was originally compiled
        from 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph files produced in the early
        1980’s.  Between 1997 and 2003, the file was updated multiple times
        using a variety of Federal and State sources, both to adjust boundaries
        and to add or delete areas as appropriate.  The final version of this
        file was produced in October, 2003.  Indian reservations were extracted
        from ATLAS-FEDLNP0310 and saved as a separate map layer, published in
        the National Atlas as Indian Lands of the United States.  The
        remaining Federal lands are included in this file.  Using USFWS, ALWRI,
        and WILDNET, the following updates were made: boundary updates to
        national wildlife refuges and wilderness areas; addition of several
        national wildlife refuges, waterfowl production areas, and wilderness
        areas; adjustment of wilderness study areas which had been converted to
        wilderness areas; and name corrections for several areas.  Adjacent
        Federal lands having identical attributes were merged.  URLs for all
        Federal lands were checked and updated as appropriate.

        The National Park units and boundaries were updated from NPS_BDY.  
        Boundaries were aligned with ATLAS-ST, ATLAS-CNTY, ATLAS-PL, ATLAS-HY,
        and BLM.  BLM land Cross Bar, TX was added.  A boundary correction 
        was made to Fort Bliss, NM-TX.  The file was processed as a geodatabase 
        before it was converted to a shapefile.

      Attribute_Definition:
        The URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is the address of a page on the
        World Wide Web.  The address, which provides the basis for establishing
        an electronic link from a client to the physical location of the page
        on an Internet server, consists of a server name, file path, and the
        page's file name.  A URL in this map layer is usually the address of a
        Federal agency website.  For example, http://www.nps.gov/crla/ is
        the address of a page that describes Crater Lake National Park.
