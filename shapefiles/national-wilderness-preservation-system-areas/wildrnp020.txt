  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer consists of National Wilderness Preservation System areas
      of 640 acres or more, in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.
      Virgin Islands.  The map layer was created by extracting these wilderness
      areas from the National Atlas map layer: Federal Lands of the United
      States.  This is a replacement for the December 2004, map layer.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
      States in the use of these data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's Arc/INFO GIS software, the map layer was checked for label 
    errors, dangling nodes, and intersections.  Polygon topology was built 
    using the BUILD command.
  Completeness_Report:
    This map layer includes National Wilderness Preservation System areas for 
    all fifty of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 
    the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Included are features of 640 acres (one square 
    mile) or more.  Generally, features under this size are not shown.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Wilderness areas were extracted from the National Atlas Federal Lands of 
        the United States map layer.  Attributes for feature type, feature name, 
        agency ownership, URL, State, and State FIPS codes were retained.  
        Adjacent wilderness areas having the same feature type and name, agency 
        ownership, and URL were merged.  State attributes of the merged 
        wilderness areas were then updated.  Label points were created for 
        polygons having no label points; they were then assigned a
        Non-Wilderness value.

        usually the address of a Federal agency website.  For example, 
        http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&wname=Unimak
        is the address of a page that describes the Unimak Wilderness.
