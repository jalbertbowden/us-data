    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer portrays the estimated use of water in counties in the 
        United States, excluding Alaska, in the year 1990.  The map layer was 
        extracted from the U.S. Geological Survey Water Resources of the United 
        States water use database, which is a long term data set that documents 
        information on water use since 1950.

        This map layer contains information about water use for public supply, 
        industrial, irrigation, mining, livestock, and thermoelectric power, by 
        county throughout the United States.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
        data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey or 
        the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.
      Supplemental_Information: 
        Further information on 1990 water use can be found in Circular 1081, 
        which provides information on the following water use categories: public 
        supply, domestic, commercial, irrigation, livestock, industrial, mining, 
        wastewater treatment, hydroelectric power, thermoelectric power, and 
        reservoir evaporation.  The circular can be found at 
        <http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/wucircular2.html>.

        Water-use data compiled by the States are stored in the USGS 
        Aggregate Water-Use Data System (AWUDS).  AWUDS is designed to store 
        both mandatory and optional data elements.  The system allows users 
        to input data, perform quality assurance and quality control, and 
        produce tables of water-use data for 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000.  
        These water-use data are used by USGS, other agencies, organizations, 
        academic institutions, and the public for research, water-management 
        decisions, trend analysis, and water-demand forecasting.

        To create maps that are similar to the maps in the National Atlas 
        <http://nationalatlas.gov/natlas/NatlasStart.asp>, wu1990t.dbf can be 
        joined to the 1990 county boundaries available from the National 
        Atlas raw data download page,

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: 
          The 1990 data were downloaded in text format and loaded into ArcView 
          as tab-delimited text.  Attributes equivalent to those in the National 
          Atlas 1995 and 2000 water use files were retained; all other water use 
          attributes were deleted.  A field containing the 5-digit FIPS code was 
          added, as was a field for the county name.  The county names were 
          obtained from the National Atlas 1990 counties file.

          Data for Alaska were deleted because the county-equivalent units did 
          not match the county data for 1990.  The FIPS code for Ste. Genevieve 
          County, MO, was corrected from 29193 to 29186.

          The file was saved as a dBASE IV table.
