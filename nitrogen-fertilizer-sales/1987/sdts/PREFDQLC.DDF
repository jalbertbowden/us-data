Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout the transfer.   Throughout the transfer, null values are denoted by adjacent delimiters.  When a subfield, either user-defined in Attribute Primary and Attribute Secondary module records, or in other SDTS module records, is implemented as fixed-length, the following null scheme is used:  (a) when information to be encoded in the subfield is known to be not applicable (undefined, not relevant), then the subfield is valued by a string of spaces; and  (b) when the information to be encoded is relevant but unknown (or missing), then the subfield is valued by a string of question marks "?".
