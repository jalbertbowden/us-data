    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer includes Holocene volcanoes, which are those thought to 
        be active in the last 10,000 years, that are within an extended area of 
        the northern hemisphere centered on the United States.  The data are a 
        subset of data available from the Global Volcanism Program, Smithsonian 
        Institution at <http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/summary.cfm>.  This 
        file is a replacement for the April 2004 map layer.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
        data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the 
        United States in the use of these data.
      Supplemental_Information:
        Further information on the Global Volcanism Program of the 
        Smithsonian Institution is available at <http://www.volcano.si.edu/>.

        A glossary of volcano terminology is available at

        Process_Description:
          The Excel spreadsheet of Volcanoes of the World (VOL) was 
          downloaded from the Global Volcanism Program Web site and converted 
          to a dBASE IV file.  West longitude and south latitude values were 
          converted to negative values.  The points that are within the 
          geographic extent of the National Atlas SHORE file were extracted.  
          The file was loaded into ArcView and a shapefile was created.

        Entity_Type_Definition:
          A vent or opening in the surface of the Earth through which magma
          erupts; it is also the landform that is constructed by the erupted
          material.  This map layer includes volcanoes thought to be active 
          in the last 10,000 years (Holocene).

        Attribute_Label: Number
        Attribute_Definition:
          The volcano number, based on a system developed by the Catalog of
          Active Volcanoes of the World (CAVW), in the format ####-##-.  The 
          first two numerals identify the region, the next two identify the 
          subregion, and the last two or three (after the hyphen) identify 
          individual volcanoes in that subregion.  When there are three final 
          characters and the last character is "=", the number is the same as 
          that found in the CAVW; where the last character is "-", the number 
          is not found in the CAVW because the region was not numbered in the 
          CAVW or has been renumbered for this map layer; where the last 
          character is a number, the volcano is in an area included in the 
          CAVW but the number is a new one that does not appear in the CAVW.

              thrown into the air during an eruption and cool in flight, 
              falling as dark volcanic rock containing cavities created by 
              trapped gas bubbles.

              basalt lava.  Basalt lava tends to build enormous, low-angle 
              cones because it flows across the ground easily and can form 
              lava tubes that enable lava to flow tens of kilometers from an 
              erupting vent with very little cooling.
